  # Keyboard mapping, buttons follow playstation layout
  # - Each entry is optional, an empty entry ("a: ") is like omitting it entirely
  # - NULL or missing entries ("a: ") are ignored, no event will be transmitted
  # - Playstation mapping layout
  # - Each single profile has its own dedicated mapping
  # - System button (start in PS layout) cannot be remapped
  # See samples here to understand how it works
